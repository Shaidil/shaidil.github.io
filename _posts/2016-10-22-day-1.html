Do ethicists steal more books?</i></a>
(Schwitzgebel, E.; 2009) the author recognizes that no impartial
research had been done on the ethical standards of professional
ethicists. Therefore, he conducted studies to discover whether
books on ethics will be missing from academic libraries in a
percentage less or equal to the ones on topics in philosophy
and <i>not</i> on ethics (philosophy was chosen to keep the
focus disciplines close). The answer is no, professional
ethicists appear to be <i>more</i> likely to steal (or borrow
for an indefinite amount of time) books than their academic
counterparts in other fields of philosophy.<br>

The study goes against the Aristotelian concept of ethics, where
it is studied not for its theoretical understanding, but in
order to become good. This brings out the question of whether
the study of ethics is something that will improve on the moral
behavior of students, or quite the opposite. Prior to this
research, the ethics of ethicists was examined only in
controlled environments, where the test subjects were more
likely to be biased toward more ethical behavior, conforming to
expectations.<br>

An interesting research paper on the <a href="http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:25606/eth-25606-01.pdf">
ethics of economists</a> is mentioned. This study shows results
that indicate that economists are generally more selfish than
other people - not because studying economics makes them more
selfish, but because those who choose to study for a career in
economics are already more selfish than the average person. Does
this mean that there is a chance that ethics is studied by those
who are more morally corrupt than others?
