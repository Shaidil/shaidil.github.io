As a continuation of my look into
<a href="#day2">the effect of estrus on lap dancers' livelihoods</a>,
I checked out a paper titled
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513808000263">Women's voice attractiveness varies across the menstrual cycle</a>
(R.N. Pipitone, G.G. Gallup Jr; 2008), which brings to light one of the
non-obvious effects of the regular menstrual cycle on women's physiology.
In this study, voice recordings of women were recorded through their
menstrual cycle, and then rated by attractiveness.  In <i>naturally</i>
cycling women, the samples showed a significant increase in
attractiveness during the part of the cycle in which conception was more
likely (for women using hormonal contraceptive products such a variation
did not exist - as is the case with the
<a href="#day2">tip earnings of lap dancers!</a>).
This study was motivated by research indicating that human behavioral
characteristics have a correlation with the variation in the sound of the
person's voice.<br>

The morphology of the larynx, the hormonal organ responsible for the
human voice, is affected by gender-specific hormones during puberty,
altering the quality of voice in women and men - also, some research
exists that indicates that there may exist a correlation between not only
the characterists of a person's voice and their physical morphology, but
also their sexual behavior! Specifically, in this case, naturally cycling
women have more <i>jitter</i> and <i>shimmer</i> in their voices, and
their voice pitch increases during ovulation.<br>

The volunteers who rated the attractiveness of women's voices were asked
to rate samples from four equidistant points in a woman's menstrual
cycle. After completing the evaluation, they were informed that all four
samples belonged to the same woman - <i>which came as a shock to the
  great majority of them!</i> Simiral results were reported by both
female and male raters. No acoustic analysis was performed, as it appears
to be difficult to pinpoint the acoustic differences between attractive
and unattractive voices.<br>

Moral of the story: avoid being catfished by conducting voice calls.
Also: we are all programmed by our hormones, choice is an illusion.
