title: (6) Marshall Islands - 2017/03/07

Oh gosh, my cooking adventure continues, with Marshall Islands! It's a collection of atolls in the Pacific Ocean, with just over 50k citizens. It's a republic in free association with the USA, and the place you've probably heard of when it comes to devastating nuclear test sites... Wikipedia has gifted me with a fascinating little piece of info: the way the Marshallese used to navigate the atolls was by use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Islands_stick_chart">stick charts</a> - basically a 2D construction of bound sticks that represents the swell wave patterns of the ocean through the atolls. The legends of the charts were non-uniform at best, and it took a skilled and groomed navigator to be able to read them successfully. These things are really cool and you should take a look!<br>
Basically everything related to this country has something to do with coconuts, so the food I made does, too (also, finding the info on food and drinks of such a small country - so small that <a href="http://www.iexplore.com/…/marshall-isl…/food-and-restaurants">this website</a> claims that there are exactly 26 restaurants in the capital, Majuro - was not an easy task). I almost broke several knives opening a pre-shelled coconut to try <b>1</b>: coconut water, I made <b>2</b>: spicy prawns with coconut rice balls and grilled pineapple, and <b>3</b>: baked papaya with coconut cream. Enough coconut already. ;___;<br>
