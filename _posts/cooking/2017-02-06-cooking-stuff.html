title: (4) Uzbekistan - 2017/02/06

<p>
I randomed Uzbekistan last week.
Uzbekistan is a doubly landlocked (the only one next to Liechtenstein) former Soviet country, whose Wiki page says that it is "officially a democratic (...) republic," but - sadly - that doesn't seem to be the case. Human rights and freedom of the press are suspicious terms when applied to this country. During the Soviet times, the land was heavily used for cotton production, drying out what little water there existed and salinizing the soil, a practice which continues today (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AralSea1989_2014.jpg">see photo</a>). I won't dwell on this too much, I'll just mention that it's estimated that only about 50% of its 32 million citizens have internet access.
I made lamb plov (yes, I know, I suck at rice) and kholvaitar (liquid halva) + green tea. Hopefully I get a country with a more optimistic reality next.<br>
