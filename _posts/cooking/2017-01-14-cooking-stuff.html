title: (1) Mongolia - 2017/01/14

<p>
This weekend I'm doing attempts at Mongolian food. The first round of buuz doesn't look too bad. :) It's pretty damn difficult to do it right, and I'm impressed and entertained. Then came a terrifying attempt at boortsog. :D It's oh-my-god-amazing fried dough and it's accompanied by suutei tsai (milk tea with salt - surprisingly good!) So far, I'm a fan of Mongolian foodstuffs.
