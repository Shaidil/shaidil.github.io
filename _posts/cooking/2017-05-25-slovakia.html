title: (7) Slovakia - 2017/05/25
---
<p>
After a bit of a hiatus, I continued with Slovakia - Europe's ping-pong ball.
For a chunk of interesting information, Slovakia is the world's largest
per-capita car producer, and it also exports a surprising amount of video
displays, but relies mostly on the tertiary sector for its GDP. Bratislava -
Slovakia's capital - is the third richest region of the European Union (after
Hamburg and Luxembourg City).<br/>

Looking at this country's political history, it's clear that they would end up
with a local cuisine heavily influenced by the many current and past neighboring
cultures... but I made due. The first attempt included fučka (potato porridge
with bacon) with milk. Its name, for us Slavs out there, seems to indeed be a
reference to its final cooking state – when it whistles. The second one included
poppy seeds, which is ever the irresistible ingredient for me. I made bobalky
(otherwise known as opekance, pupanky, makowki, …), which are morsels of baked
leavened dough, doused in poppy seeds boiled in milk. Just a little decadent and
sweet, they’re part of the traditional Christmas dinner.<br/>
