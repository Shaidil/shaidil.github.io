title: (3) Germany - 2017/01/29
---
<p>
The third country I randomed for my cooking experiment was (because I can never seem to get away from it), naturally, Germany. After going through all of the ways this is a bad idea, I obtained help from a native (thank you, Marius Lewerenz :) ) and made two representative (or so he claims) meals. Meat Roulade with Klöße (potato dumplings) and red cabbage, and then Dampfnudeln (sweet dumplings) with vanilla sauce.
In conclusion, I was perfectly right when I said German food is complicated to make; this took hours and patience.<br>
