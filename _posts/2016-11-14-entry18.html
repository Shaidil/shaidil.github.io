The author of <a href="http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877(08)00115-1/abstract>Ejaculation as a potential treatment of nasal congestion in mature males</a> (S. Zarrintan; 2008) would like for us to think outside of the book, by proposing a novel method to potentially aleviate the problems of nasal congestion.<br>
Nasal congestion is the blockage of nasal passages, where the membranes lining the nasal passages can get swollen when the blood vessels in them become inflamed. The author stresses that this can occur in response to certain illnesses, but also exercise, exposure to cold air and spicy food, or simply stress. Additionally, it has been shown that nasal congestion may lower the sufferer's quality of life and decrease their self-esteem. Decongestants act as vasoconstrictants of these blood vessels, but in doing so, they may have negative effects on other ailments that the patient may have, as is the case with hypertension, and they can even have the opposite effect if used for more than a few days!<br>
The author suggests that ejaculation (in <i>mature men</i>, they stress) may be used as a possible treatment to nasal congestion, as its emission phase leads to vasoconstriction and a nasal decongestion that lasts throughout the refractory period. No suggestions were provided for women. If you are a mature man and you want to go <i>all natural</i> in the fight of seasonal illnesses this winter, ejaculation could be the way to go. Please report your findings.
