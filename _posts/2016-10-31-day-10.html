The title of
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673605658126">On human odour, malaria mosquitoes, and Limburger cheese</a>
(B. GJ Knols; 1996) sounds like it promises to provide the well-expected
connection of smelly cheeses and human stink, but it goes even beyond
that - it hypothesizes that smelly cheese may be more attractive to
mosquitoes than the stink of human sweat, and may be used as a decoy. It
had been indicated that carbon dioxide (exhaled by potential hosts) seems
to be crucial for the host-seeking behavior of blood-feeding insects;
other factors seem mostly unknown, and specific to particular
species.<br>

It has also been discovered that different species of mosquitoes are
attracted to different parts of the human body. The <i>Anopheles
  gambiae</i> mosquito species was found to prefer biting ankles and
feet of brave volunteers, and they were also successfully lured to the
scent of Limburger cheese, the smell of which is very similar to the
bacteria that lives between the toes on human feet.<br>

In the words of the author, <i>"(...) medical entomologists are now
  buying Limburger cheese and taking it to mosquito-infested areas
  around the globe. Whether or not they will manage to attract another
  mosquito species with Limburger cheese remains to be seen (if not
  they can always eat it)."</i>
