feathers?" A potential perceptual basis of a cognitive riddle</i></a>
(Wagman, J. B., Zimmerman, C., Sorric, C.; 2007) is a fun exercise in
scientific work which tells us that the <i>naive</i> answer to this
simple question just might not be that naive. In psychology it is known
that two objects of equal mass can feel unequally heavy depending on
their mass distribution - the object with smaller volume (greater
density) feels heavier, which is known as the <i>size-weight
  illusion</i>.<br>

Lead and feathers were poured and stuffed in boxes of equal size, and
blindfolded volunteers were asked to report on their comparative weight.
Over 70% of the volunteers reported the lead box to be heavier than the
box of feeathers! It turns out that this experiment confirms previous
findings on the perception of heaviness of an object; it is a function of
the object's dynamical symmetry, which determines the direction and
magnitude of muscular actions required to hold the object. An object with
more dynamical symmetry requires less action to control, therefore
feeling less heavy than an object with less dynamical symmetry, but the
same total weight.<br>

Thus, the old question can finally be answered. Which feels heavier - a
pound of lead or a pound of feathers? A pound of lead. Just cite this
study to lesser academic acolytes.
