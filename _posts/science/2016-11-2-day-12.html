Is beauty a social construct? Chickens say no in
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192929">Chickens prefer beautiful humans</a>
(S. Ghirlanda, L. Jansson, M. Enquist; 2002). In this study, chickens were
<i>trained</i> to respond to (peck at) an average human female face, but not an
average human male face (and vice-versa for cocks) - following this those
chickens were found to show preference for faces that ranked higher when rated
on sexual preference by (human) volunteers.<br>

Moreover, contrary to the postulate that desired recipients of sexual signals
had developed a biological adaptation that would enable them to read those
signals, this study implies that this might not be the case, and that human
preferences may arise from general properties of nervous systems. In fact, they
may be related to the obvious sexual differentiation characteristics - the
easier it is to identify a human face as belonging to a specific gender, the
more attractive is it perceived.<br>

The chickens were trained in several steps: their food source was removed 12
hours before the session, and they would receive access to food for a short
period of time every time they would peck at the target type of face. The human
volunteers were not trained, sadly. These two groups rated (or pecked at) the
faces in an almost identical fashion, and repeated tests showed very similar
results.
