Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers:
economic evidence for human estrus?</i></a>
(Miller, G., Tybur J. M., Jordan,
B.D.; 2007) are a great mix of - and, as the authors say - have
clear implications for human evolution, sexuality, and
economic. In this study, the effects of ovulatory cycles on tip
earnings of professional female lap dancers working in
gentlemen's clubs were examined. During estrus (period of
maximum sexual receptivity in females of many animal species),
lap dancers earned almost twice as much money in tips than
during menstruation (and 50% more than during the luteal
phase). However, for those lap dancers who were using hormonal
contraceptive pills an increase in tip earnings during the same
time frame did not occur. Fascinatingly enough, women who were
using contraceptive pills on average earned less tips than those
who weren't, throughout whole the cycle (approximately two
thirds less per cycle)!<br>

Some previous studies showed that women become more attractive
during estrus (body scent, facial attractiveness, waist-to-hip
ration, verbal fluency, ...), as well as that they tend to dress
more attractively, and that their male partners become more
protective of them. This (small, with only 18 participating
women) study presents the first real-world economic evidence of
such an effect.<br>

This beautiful paper also contains a collection of references
for interviews with gentlemen's clubs' managers, as well as a
detailed introduction to a working day of a lap dancer, for
academics who <i>"may be unfamiliar with the (...) subculture."</i>
