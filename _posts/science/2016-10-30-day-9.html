Prior to the publication of
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401700002740">A comparison of jump performances of the dog flea, Ctenocephalides canis (Curtis, 1826) and the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis felis (Bouch√©, 1835)</a>
(M.-C. Cadiergues, C. Joubert, M. Franc; 2000), most performance
measurements for fleas were performed with the oriental rat flea
(Xenopsylla cheopis), which is well-known for being the primary vector
for the bubonic plague. The authors don't explain why they conducted this
research, but the fact that their lab had been <i>maintaining</i> a
colony of cat fleas on cats and dog fleas on dogs for years makes the
decision sound like it came on a particularly boring Saturday morning,
after a night of heavy drinking.<br>

They put together an experimental setup for horizontal jump measurements:
sticky plastic, and for vertical jump measurements: vertical cylindric
tubes of varying height. They measured the horizontally leaped distances
for <i>nine hundred</i> different fleas, and the vertically leaped
distances for <i>one thousand and five hundred</i>; and presumably stayed
sane until the end of the process. Standardly, fleas walk while on a host
- they only engage in jumping when they get disturbed, or if the host's
temperature decreases.<br>

The dog fleas' jumps were significantly longer and higher than the cat
fleas', which makes perfect sense.
