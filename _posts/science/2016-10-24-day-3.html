In 1994, Bakkevig and Nielsen explored one of the great existential problems
that are central to the life of a toddler -

Impact of wet underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort in the cold</i></a>
(Bakkevig, M. K., Nielsen, R.; 1994). We find out important details on
how peeing ourselves affects our thermoregulatory responses and comfort,
and what kind of underwear is the absolute best to pee ourselves (or
sweat profusely) in. The eight lucky volunteers also had their skin
temperature, weight loss, and rectal temperature (by use of a thermometer
inserted 80 mm beyond the anal sphincter) measured through resting
periods of 60 minutes, discovering that the thickness of the underwear
has much more of an influence than the types of fibres used. These heroes
endured their troubles even though apparently, between takes, the
underwear was laundered only without the use of any detergent, to prevent
textile characterstics from changing during experimentation.<br>

The insulation of a clothing ensemble is mainly determined by the amount
of air trapped by the textile - as the air in the textile cavities is
replaced by sweat, the higher thermal conductivity of water as compared
to air reduces the insulating properties of a clothing item, and more
heat is absorbed for vaporation from the skin surface or from the
material itself. A sensible solution was suggested by using 2-layer
underwear, with hydrophilic fibers (wool) on the outside, and hydrophobic
fibers (polypropylene) on the inside of the item. Additionally, even
though the objectively measured properties were fairly similar, the
volunteers consistently reported feeling colder while wearing a 1-by-1
knit construction underwear, when compared to a fishnet structure.<br>

In conclusion, this study provides hard, experimental evidence that wet
underwear feels more cold and more wet than dry underwear.
