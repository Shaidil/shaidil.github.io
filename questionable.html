            The <b>Questionable Journal Club</b> is a journal club of the PhD students
in the International Max Planck Research School on Quantum Science and Technology (IMPRS-QST),
focused on exploring scientific research and its representations in various media. It strives
 to demistify the full scientific process to starting PhD students, and to provide means and 
an opportunity to retain a bright outlook and the idea of scientific work being entertaining, 
while allowing for analyses of others' work in a non-intimidating and largely inconsequential
 environment.<br>
