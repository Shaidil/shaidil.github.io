         <h2 id="intro">Questionable Journal Club</h2>
            The <b>Questionable Journal Club</b> is a journal club of the PhD students
in the International Max Planck Research School of Quantum Science and Technology (<a href="http://www.imprs-quantum.mpg.de">IMPRS-QST</a>),
focused on exploring compelling scientific research of questionable utility and its representations in various media. It strives
 to demystify the full scientific process to starting PhD students, and to provide means and 
an opportunity to retain a bright outlook and the idea of scientific work being entertaining, 
while allowing for analyses of others' work in a non-intimidating and largely inconsequential
 environment.<br><br>

The club meets at one of the participating institutions in Munich or Garching, approximately once every three weeks.
 The summaries and plans for meetings will be posted on this page.<br>
If you have any ideas or suggestions for the club, please contact <a href="http://www.happyturtlethings.net">Ivana Kurecic</a> through <a href="mailto:happyturtlethings@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.
