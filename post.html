    <p style="color:#FFFFFF";><p style="color:#FFFFFF";>The results of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513807000694"><i>Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers: economic evidence for human estrus?</i></a> (Miller, G., Tybur J. M., Jordan, B.D.; 2007) are a great mix of - and, as the authors say - have clear implications for human evolution, sexuality, and economic. In this study, the effects of ovulatory cycles on tip earnings of professional female lap dancers working in gentlemen's clubs were examined. During estrus (period of maximum sexual receptivity in females of many animal species), lap dancers earned almost twice as much money in tips than during menstruation (and 50% more than during the luteal phase). However, for those lap dancers who were using hormonal contraceptive pills an increase in tip earnings during the same time frame did not occur. Fascinatingly enough, women who were using contraceptive pills on average earned less tips than those who weren't, throughout whole the cycle (approximately two thirds less per cycle)!<br>
Some previous studies showed that women become more attractive during estrus (body scent, facial attractiveness, waist-to-hip ration, verbal fluency, ...), as well as that they tend to dress more attractively, and that their male partners become more protective of them. This (small, with only 18 participating women) study presents the first real-world economic evidence of such an effect.<br>
This beautiful paper also contains a collection of references for interviews with gentlemen's clubs' managers, as well as a detailed introduction to a working day of a lap dancer, for academics who <i>"may be unfamiliar with the (...) subculture."</i>  </p>

    <p style="color:#FFFFFF";>In <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09515080903409952"><i>Do ethicists steal more books?</i></a> (Schwitzgebel, E.; 2009) the author recognizes that no impartial research had been done on the ethical standards of professional ethicists. Therefore, he conducted studies to discover whether books on ethics will be missing from academic libraries in a percentage less or equal to the ones on topics in philosophy and <i>not</i> on ethics (philosophy was chosen to keep the focus disciplines close). The answer is no, professional ethicists appear to be <i>more</i> likely to steal (or borrow for an indefinite amount of time) books than their academic counterparts in other fields of philosophy.<br>
      The study goes against the Aristotelian concept of ethics, where it is studied not for its theoretical understanding, but in order to become good. This brings out the question of whether the study of ethics is something that will improve on the moral behavior of students, or quite the opposite. Prior to this research, the ethics of ethicists was examined only in controlled environments, where the test subjects were more likely to be biased toward more ethical behavior, conforming to expectations.<br>
      An interesting research paper on the <a href="http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:25606/eth-25606-01.pdf">ethics of economists</a> is mentioned. This study shows results that indicate that economists are generally more selfish than other people - not because studying economics makes them more selfish, but because those who choose to study for a career in economics are already more selfish than the average person. Does this mean that there is a chance that ethics is studied by those who are more morally corrupt than others?
