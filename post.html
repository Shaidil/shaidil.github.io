    <h3>Day 3 (2016/10/24)</h3>
    <p>
      In 1994, Bakkevig and Nielsen explored one of the great existential problems that are central to the life of a toddler -
      <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139408964916"><i>
	  Impact of wet underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort in the cold</i></a>
      (Bakkevig, M. K., Nielsen, R.; 1994). We find out important details on how peeing ourselves affects our thermoregulatory responses and comfort, and what kind of underwear is the absolute best to pee ourselves (or sweat profusely) in. The eight lucky volunteers also had their skin temperature, weight loss, and rectal temperature (by use of a thermometer inserted 80mm beyond the anal sphincter) measured through resting periods of 60 minutes, discovering that the thickness of the underwear has much more of an influence than the types of fibres used. These heroes endured their troubles even though apparently, between takes, the underwear was laundered only without the use of any detergent, to prevent textile characterstics from changing during experimentation.<br>

The insulation of a clothing ensemble is mainly determined by the amount of air trapped by the textile - as the air in the textile cavities is replaced by sweat, the higher thermal conductivity of water as compared to air reduces the insulating properties of a clothing item, and more heat is absorbed for vaporation from the skin surface or from the material itself. A sensible solution was suggested by using 2-layer underwear, with hydrophilic fibers (wool) on the outside, and hydrophobic fibers (polypropylene) on the inside of the item. Additionally, even though the objectively measured properties were fairly similar, the volunteers consistently reported feeling colder while wearing a 1-by-1 knit construction underwear, when compared to a fishnet structure.<br>

In conclusion, this study provides hard, experimental evidence that wet underwear feels more cold and more wet than dry underwear.

      The results of
      <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513807000694"><i>
	  Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers:
	  economic evidence for human estrus?</i></a>
      (Miller, G., Tybur J. M., Jordan,
      B.D.; 2007) are a great mix of - and, as the authors say - have
      clear implications for human evolution, sexuality, and
      economic. In this study, the effects of ovulatory cycles on tip
      earnings of professional female lap dancers working in
      gentlemen's clubs were examined. During estrus (period of
      maximum sexual receptivity in females of many animal species),
      lap dancers earned almost twice as much money in tips than
      during menstruation (and 50% more than during the luteal
      phase). However, for those lap dancers who were using hormonal
      contraceptive pills an increase in tip earnings during the same
      time frame did not occur. Fascinatingly enough, women who were
      using contraceptive pills on average earned less tips than those
      who weren't, throughout whole the cycle (approximately two
      thirds less per cycle)!<br>

      Some previous studies showed that women become more attractive
      during estrus (body scent, facial attractiveness, waist-to-hip
      ration, verbal fluency, ...), as well as that they tend to dress
      more attractively, and that their male partners become more
      protective of them. This (small, with only 18 participating
      women) study presents the first real-world economic evidence of
      such an effect.<br>

      This beautiful paper also contains a collection of references
      for interviews with gentlemen's clubs' managers, as well as a
      detailed introduction to a working day of a lap dancer, for
      academics who <i>"may be unfamiliar with the (...) subculture."</i>

    <h3>Day 1 (2016/10/22)</h3>
    <p>
      In
      <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09515080903409952"><i>
	  Do ethicists steal more books?</i></a>
      (Schwitzgebel, E.; 2009) the author recognizes that no impartial
      research had been done on the ethical standards of professional
      ethicists. Therefore, he conducted studies to discover whether
      books on ethics will be missing from academic libraries in a
      percentage less or equal to the ones on topics in philosophy
      and <i>not</i> on ethics (philosophy was chosen to keep the
      focus disciplines close). The answer is no, professional
      ethicists appear to be <i>more</i> likely to steal (or borrow
      for an indefinite amount of time) books than their academic
      counterparts in other fields of philosophy.<br>

      The study goes against the Aristotelian concept of ethics, where
      it is studied not for its theoretical understanding, but in
      order to become good. This brings out the question of whether
      the study of ethics is something that will improve on the moral
      behavior of students, or quite the opposite. Prior to this
      research, the ethics of ethicists was examined only in
      controlled environments, where the test subjects were more
      likely to be biased toward more ethical behavior, conforming to
      expectations.<br>

      An interesting research paper on the <a href="http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:25606/eth-25606-01.pdf">
      ethics of economists</a> is mentioned. This study shows results
      that indicate that economists are generally more selfish than
      other people - not because studying economics makes them more
      selfish, but because those who choose to study for a career in
      economics are already more selfish than the average person. Does
      this mean that there is a chance that ethics is studied by those
      who are more morally corrupt than others?
