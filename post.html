	Prior to the publication of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401700002740">A comparison of jump performances of the dog flea, Ctenocephalides canis (Curtis, 1826) and the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis felis (Bouch√©, 1835)</a> (M.-C. Cadiergues, C. Joubert, M. Franc; 2000), most performance measurements for fleas were performed with the oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis), which is well-known for being the primary vector for the bubonic plague. The authors don't explain why they conducted this research, but the fact that their lab had been <i>maintaining</i> a colony of cat fleas on cats and dog fleas on dogs for years makes the decision sound like it came on a particularly boring Saturday morning, after a night of heavy drinking.<br>

They put together an experimental setup for horizontal jump measurements: sticky plastic, and for vertical jump measurements: vertical cylindric tubes of varying height. They measured the horizontally leaped distances for <i>nine hundred</i> different fleas, and the vertically leaped distances for <i>one thousand and five hundred</i>; and presumably stayed sane until the end of the process. Standardly, fleas walk while on a host - they only engage in jumping when they get disturbed, or if the host's temperature decreases.<br>

The dog fleas' jumps were significantly longer and higher than the cat fleas', which makes perfect sense.

	As a continuation of my look into <a href="#day2">the effect of estrus on lap dancers' livelihoods</a>, I checked out a paper titled <a href="">Women's voice attractiveness varies across the menstrual cycle</a> (R.N. Pipitone, G.G. Gallup Jr; 2008), which brings to light one of the non-obvious effects of the regular menstrual cycle on women's physiology. In this study, voice recordings of women were recorded through their menstrual cycle, and then rated by attractiveness. In <i>naturally</i> cycling women, the samples showed a significant increase in attractiveness during the part of the cycle in which conception was more likely (for women using hormonal contraceptive products such a variation did not exist - as is the case with the <a href="#day2">tip earnings of lap dancers!</a>). This study was motivated by research indicating that human behavioral characteristics have a correlation with the variation in the sound of the person's voice.<br>

The morphology of the larynx, the hormonal organ responsible for the human voice, is affected by gender-specific hormones during puberty, altering the quality of voice in women and men - also, some research exists that indicates that there may exist a correlation between not only the characterists of a person's voice and their physical morphology, but also their sexual behavior! Specifically, in this case, naturally cycling women have more <i>jitter</i> and <i>shimmer</i> in their voices, and their voice pitch increases during ovulation.<br>

The volunteers who rated the attractiveness of women's voices were asked to rate samples from four equidistant points in a woman's menstrual cycle. After completing the evaluation, they were informed that all four samples belonged to the same woman - <i>which came as a shock to the great majority of them!</i> Simiral results were reported by both female and male raters. No acoustic analysis was performed, as it appears to be difficult to pinpoint the acoustic differences between attractive and unattractive voices.<br>

Moral of the story: avoid being catfished by conducting voice calls. Also: we are all programmed by our hormones, choice is an illusion.

	A team of pathologists and physicists collaborated to produce <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X08001728">Are full or empty beer bottles sturdier and does their fracture-threshold suffice to break the human skull?</a> (S.A. Bolliger, S. Ross, L. Oesterhelweg, M.J. Thali, B.P. Kneubuehl; 2008), in a quest to conclude whether beer bottles can fracture the human skull, by comparing the fracture-threshold of beer bottles with the one of the human skull (broken bottles may cause sharp trauma, while those that remain intact may cause blunt injuries). They experimentally tested this unknown, by releasing beer bottles in a homemade drop-tower (ending in a baby bathtub). A steel ball was released to fall on the bottles from different heights. Their sample size was rather small (10 bottles in total), which could be the result of a general appreciation of beer in academic circles and the reluctance to let it go to waste. In conclusion, full bottles broke at 30 J impact energy, and the empty ones at 40 J (the experiment was conducted with 5 J impact energy increments), with both of those energies being enough to break the human skull. If the bottle breaks below this energy, it would not cause skull fractures.<br>

Generally, broken glass bottles may cause stab and cut injuries, so it had been advocated to produce beer bottles out of glass with higher impact resistance. However, bottles that do not break may be used as blunt weapons and may, indeed, be used to cause skull fractures. Compared to beer glasses, which break at as low as 1.7 J, beer bottles are much less safe. Considering the weight of the bottles under the same conditions, the full one will hit the target with much more force than the empty one.<br>

The moral of the story? Beer bottles can break skulls, but it's a bit less likely if they're still full (both because of physics and because the bottle user is more likely to be sober). The authors propose a prohibition of beer bottles in dangerous situations, in favor of beer glasses.

	I'm prefacing this with saying that I don't know anything about <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7582/1285">Sword swallowing and its side effects</a> (B. Witcombe, D. Meyer; 2006), aside from what I've learned from the works of Penn&Teller, and after reading this I am terribly unclear on why anybody would subject themselves to it.<br>

The paper is based on a poll shared with the members of The Sword Swallowers' Association International, and the great majority of these reported to have experienced injury while swallowing swords - everything from sore throats to neck perforations, to transabdominal surgery after <i>actually swallowing</i> one. But they rarely consulted physicians. On the bright side, no recorded deaths caused by sword swallowing had been reported. An interesting find is that no apparent correlation existed between the size of the swallower and the largest sword swallowed.<br>

If you're interested in the mechanics and dangers of sword swallowing, check out this paper. Or don't. Frankly, nobody should be doing this to themselves.

	A gastronomically exciting title, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00778.x/full">Optimizing the sensory characteristics and acceptance of canned cat food: use of a human taste panel</a> (G.J. Pickering; 2008), invites us to stretch the public understanding of social mores, by refining the methodology used in the evaluation of food prepared for human consumption, and applying it to the profiling of cat food products. This ingenious approach defined multiple (eighteen) flavor attributes and texture dimensiones (four) of the food, and surrendered different commercial cat food samples to the human panel which was chosen on the basis of, among other things, the absence of aversion in tasting the products.<br>

It is important to note that cats do lack receptors for sweet-tasting substances. They are also quite fussy in their food preferences and - as we are reminded in the paper - unable to verbalize their likes and dislikes. The study provides a baseline protocol for human evaluation of cat food products.<br>

The author solemnly underlines that what should follow the research would be a search for the usefulness of the gathered data.

      <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5585974_Last_but_not_least_which_feels_heavier_-_A_pound_of_lead_or_a_pound_of_feathers_A_potential_perceptual_basis_of_a_cognitive_riddle"><i>"Which feels heavier - a pound of lead or a pound of
feathers?" A potential perceptual basis of a cognitive riddle</i></a> (Wagman, J. B., Zimmerman, C., Sorric, C.; 2007) is a fun exercise in scientific work which tells us that the <i>naive</i> answer to this simple question just might not be that naive. In psychology it is known that two objects of equal mass can feel unequally heavy depending on their mass distribution - the object with smaller volume (greater density) feels heavier, which is known as the <i>size-weight illusion</i>.<br>

Lead and feathers were poured and stuffed in boxes of equal size, and blindfolded volunteers were asked to report on their comparative weight. Over 70% of the volunteers reported the lead box to be heavier than the box of feeathers! It turns out that this experiment confirms previous findings on the perception of heaviness of an object; it is a function of the object's dynamical symmetry, which determines the direction and magnitude of muscular actions required to hold the object. An object with more dynamical symmetry requires less action to control, therefore feeling less heavy than an object with less dynamical symmetry, but the same total weight.<br>

Thus, the old question can finally be answered. Which feels heavier - a pound of lead or a pound of feathers? A pound of lead. Just cite this study to lesser academic acolytes.

      In 1994, Bakkevig and Nielsen explored one of the great existential problems that are central to the life of a toddler -
      <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139408964916"><i>
	  Impact of wet underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort in the cold</i></a>
      (Bakkevig, M. K., Nielsen, R.; 1994). We find out important details on how peeing ourselves affects our thermoregulatory responses and comfort, and what kind of underwear is the absolute best to pee ourselves (or sweat profusely) in. The eight lucky volunteers also had their skin temperature, weight loss, and rectal temperature (by use of a thermometer inserted 80 mm beyond the anal sphincter) measured through resting periods of 60 minutes, discovering that the thickness of the underwear has much more of an influence than the types of fibres used. These heroes endured their troubles even though apparently, between takes, the underwear was laundered only without the use of any detergent, to prevent textile characterstics from changing during experimentation.<br>

The insulation of a clothing ensemble is mainly determined by the amount of air trapped by the textile - as the air in the textile cavities is replaced by sweat, the higher thermal conductivity of water as compared to air reduces the insulating properties of a clothing item, and more heat is absorbed for vaporation from the skin surface or from the material itself. A sensible solution was suggested by using 2-layer underwear, with hydrophilic fibers (wool) on the outside, and hydrophobic fibers (polypropylene) on the inside of the item. Additionally, even though the objectively measured properties were fairly similar, the volunteers consistently reported feeling colder while wearing a 1-by-1 knit construction underwear, when compared to a fishnet structure.<br>

In conclusion, this study provides hard, experimental evidence that wet underwear feels more cold and more wet than dry underwear.

      The results of
      <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513807000694"><i>
	  Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers:
	  economic evidence for human estrus?</i></a>
      (Miller, G., Tybur J. M., Jordan,
      B.D.; 2007) are a great mix of - and, as the authors say - have
      clear implications for human evolution, sexuality, and
      economic. In this study, the effects of ovulatory cycles on tip
      earnings of professional female lap dancers working in
      gentlemen's clubs were examined. During estrus (period of
      maximum sexual receptivity in females of many animal species),
      lap dancers earned almost twice as much money in tips than
      during menstruation (and 50% more than during the luteal
      phase). However, for those lap dancers who were using hormonal
      contraceptive pills an increase in tip earnings during the same
      time frame did not occur. Fascinatingly enough, women who were
      using contraceptive pills on average earned less tips than those
      who weren't, throughout whole the cycle (approximately two
      thirds less per cycle)!<br>

      Some previous studies showed that women become more attractive
      during estrus (body scent, facial attractiveness, waist-to-hip
      ration, verbal fluency, ...), as well as that they tend to dress
      more attractively, and that their male partners become more
      protective of them. This (small, with only 18 participating
      women) study presents the first real-world economic evidence of
      such an effect.<br>

      This beautiful paper also contains a collection of references
      for interviews with gentlemen's clubs' managers, as well as a
      detailed introduction to a working day of a lap dancer, for
      academics who <i>"may be unfamiliar with the (...) subculture."</i>

      In
      <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09515080903409952"><i>
	  Do ethicists steal more books?</i></a>
      (Schwitzgebel, E.; 2009) the author recognizes that no impartial
      research had been done on the ethical standards of professional
      ethicists. Therefore, he conducted studies to discover whether
      books on ethics will be missing from academic libraries in a
      percentage less or equal to the ones on topics in philosophy
      and <i>not</i> on ethics (philosophy was chosen to keep the
      focus disciplines close). The answer is no, professional
      ethicists appear to be <i>more</i> likely to steal (or borrow
      for an indefinite amount of time) books than their academic
      counterparts in other fields of philosophy.<br>

      The study goes against the Aristotelian concept of ethics, where
      it is studied not for its theoretical understanding, but in
      order to become good. This brings out the question of whether
      the study of ethics is something that will improve on the moral
      behavior of students, or quite the opposite. Prior to this
      research, the ethics of ethicists was examined only in
      controlled environments, where the test subjects were more
      likely to be biased toward more ethical behavior, conforming to
      expectations.<br>

      An interesting research paper on the <a href="http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:25606/eth-25606-01.pdf">
      ethics of economists</a> is mentioned. This study shows results
      that indicate that economists are generally more selfish than
      other people - not because studying economics makes them more
      selfish, but because those who choose to study for a career in
      economics are already more selfish than the average person. Does
      this mean that there is a chance that ethics is studied by those
      who are more morally corrupt than others?
